ASPLOS provides a high quality forum for scientists and engineers to present their latest research findings in these rapidly changing fields. It has captured some of the major computer systems innovations of the past two decades (e.g., RISC and VLIW processors, small and large-scale multiprocessors, clusters and networks-of-workstations, optimizing compilers, RAID, and network-storage system designs).


This conference occurs at a time when computer architecture is facing great challenges, due both to the end of single-processor performance scaling and to new demands imposed by mobile and gigascale computing. Multi-disciplinary research is increasingly important as boundaries between hardware/software and local/network computing blur, as the form and capabilities of computing devices beco","https://portalparts.acm.org/event_logos/RE178.jpg","","http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/events/asplos08/default.htm","Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems","https://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE178"

The symposium provides an international forum for discussion of the problems of engineering database systems involving not only database technology but the related areas of information retrieval, multimedia, human machine interface and communication. The goal of IDEAS is to foster closer interaction among the industrial, research and user communities and provides an excellent opportunity for them to meet, discuss ideas, examine the current ones and develop new solutions and research directions. Along with the technical sessions, the symposium also features prominent invited speakers.
IDEAS series of symposiums are scheduled annually and have been held since 1997 in North America, Europe and Asia. It has attracted participants from governmental and non-governmental agencies, industries, and academia to exchange ideas and share experiences.","https://portalparts.acm.org/event_logos/355/355.jpg","","http://ideas.encs.concordia.ca/ideas11/CFP.html","International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium","https://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE194"

The EuroSys conference series brings together professionals from academia and industry. It has a strong focus on systems research and development: operating systems, data base systems, real-time systems and middleware for networked, distributed, parallel, or embedded computing systems. As a highly recognized conference, EuroSys has become a premier forum for discussing various issues of systems software research and development, including implications related to hardware and applications.


Future EuroSys conferences will follow the pattern established by the previous EuroSys conferences, by seeking papers on all aspects of computer systems. EuroSys conferences will also include a number of workshops to allow junior and senior members of the systems community to explore leading-edge topics and ideas before they are presented at a conference.","https://portalparts.acm.org/event_logos/RE101.jpg","","http://eurosys2011.cs.uni-salzburg.at/","European Conference on Computer Systems","https://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE101"
